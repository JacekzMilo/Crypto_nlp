one of the most flawed assumptions in my eyes is that bitcoin mining needs to be profitable in the first place.,0.0,0.873,0.127,0.4404
assuming that miners will always be giant warehouses full of computers consuming energy secondhand from the power companies then yeah bitcoin mining companies will always need to remain profitable.,0.0,0.783,0.217,0.7351
an interesting discussion that i ’ ve heard floated on podcasts recently is the theory that energy companies will begin to acquire bitcoin mining companies or that bitcoin mining companies will begin to acquire energy producers.,0.0,0.818,0.182,0.7096
either way it ’ s a winwin and helps to alleviate the need for bitcoin miners to be profitable at all.,0.0,0.744,0.256,0.6705
merging bitcoin mining and energy production could resolve this problem completely.,0.197,0.506,0.297,0.1469
