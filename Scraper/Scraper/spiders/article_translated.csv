Earning on indices and ETFs in the crypto world,"“Which DeFi project should you choose? Which coin to enter now? More than once this question has been circulating in your head. The answer to it is ""none."" However, this does not mean that you should stay out of the market. Contents In order not to waste your time, let's determine if this article is addressed to you? If you are a person already on the cryptocurrency market or just taking their first steps on it, then maybe yes. Perhaps yes, you will change for sure if you are not passionate about the crypto market and do not treat it as your main occupation. If you don't spend a few hours every day researching projects and the market, but want to profit from the upward cryptocurrency trends, this article is written just for you. If, on the other hand, you are a cryptocurrency bank, then ... maybe for you too. Because the crypto landscape is now so extensive that no one is able to comprehend it completely on their own. Because today we will tell you about how to earn (which also involves the risk of loss) on crypto trends, without the need to tediously select projects in which we want to invest. We have two very interesting instruments in traditional financial markets. Indices and ETFs. Their common feature is their basket structure. Let's start with the indexes. Probably everyone who has anything to do with financial markets has heard about such stock exchange indices as Dow Jones, SP500, DAX or our Polish WIG20. Such an index is a basket with selected values ​​to which their weight is assigned. The weight determines how much influence the value of the index has on the price of a given stock. For example, the WIG20 index is an index of the twenty largest companies on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. Each of these twenty companies has a specific weight with which it affects the value of the index. Indices seem to be a great investment vehicle for people with the approach: I do not know, but they will earn (on a growing market or a trend). I don't have to choose individual stocks, I take the entire index. Which reflects the entire market (WIG), its specific segment (WIG20) or the industry (WIG.Games). There is only one problem - indices are not a financial instrument. They are a statistical tool that illustrates price changes in individual markets, segments and industries. We can track and observe the value of an index, but we cannot buy an index unit. And here, on traditional markets, ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) come to our aid. Among them, I will say, we have the so-called index funds. They are a passive investment tool whose portfolio qualitatively and quantitatively reflects a given index. These are instruments that have been enjoying increasing popularity for years. Especially in foreign markets. And no wonder: it is simple and cheap to use, at the same time allowing you to catch the upward trend of a given market or trend. Until now, there has been little talk about indices on cryptocurrency exchanges. The community did not particularly feel the need to create them. Perhaps because, unlike traditional exchanges, where most companies are listed on one market, the most popular coins in crypto are listed on dozens or even hundreds of exchanges. And since most of the most highly valued coins on individual stock exchanges are the same, their indices would be characterized by a very high correlation. Hence the boom of such websites as coinmarketcap or coingecko, which aggregate statistical data on the entire cryptocurrency market. The situation started to change a bit this year, thanks to DeFi. First, we started to have a certain trend in the market that was not correlated with the entire market. Secondly, it is DeFi that is a place where new financial products can be created. So at the moment, these are the most common indices available on decentralized platforms, the vast majority of which try to reflect the trend of decentralized finance. Since these indices have a tokenized form (you can buy a token, i.e. a unit of the index), we can say that they are also ETFs. Two in one. Feel free to review decentralized crypto indices! The indexes I present are based on decentralized solutions. However, recently there are also indices created by centralized exchanges, the tokens of which we can buy on them. There was no place for them in this article, but we will mention them during. In all the cases discussed, these indices allow us to participate in the DeFi trend. We will probably have to wait for other solutions. I myself would like to see indexes with names like ORACLES, ETHKILLERS or POLKADOT. Most likely the first decentralized index on the market, allowing us to be exposed to the DeFi trend. Its first version appeared over a year ago, at the end of November 2019. In the middle of the hot DeFi summer, the composition of the index has changed. There are new coins and the possibility of dynamic management of the composition and weights of the index. At the time of writing this article, the composition of the sDeFi index was as follows: Capitalization: USD 3.9 million This index is an element. This means that it is not backed by actual project tokens in the index. And its value is based on the price information collected from the outside (using the CHAINLINK oracle). The advantage of this solution is the lack of price deviations of the index token even with its relatively low liquidity. This is due to the mechanism of operation of the Synthetix Network, in which each of the tokens uses the full liquidity of the protocol, and the price always comes from the oracle and the transactions that are not concluded do not change it. Learn more about the mechanics behind sDEFI and other synthetic Synthetix tokens in. The token can be purchased at. An interesting fact is that sDEFI also has its inverted twin brother iDEFI. It is a token whose price changes inversely to the price of the coins included in the index. It is therefore the perfect tool to short on the trend of decentralized finance. The PieDAO project offers several different products that we can call cryptocurrency indices or ETFs. Let's take a look at a few of them, bearing in mind that the community is constantly presenting proposals for new indexes that may appear on PieDAO in some time. PieDAO underneath uses a Balancer. So the indexes from this project contain the actual tokens of the projects included in the index underneath. Moreover, they represent a liquidity pool for decentralized applications, therefore they generate additional revenue from fees from token traders based on these pools. DeFi Large Capitalization Index. It contains proven projects, so it is a good solution for conservative investors who do not want to risk looking for new trend stars. They are interested in a more certain and stable profit from the further growth of the trend, which is why they bet on its current leaders. Index Composition: Capitalization: $ 2 Million. DeFi Small Capitalization Project Index. You could say that this is an index of potential DeFi emerging stars. On those who manage to shine, it will be possible to earn more than the market rate of return. However, we have the risk that not all projects will be able to do this. Index composition: Capitalization: $ 1.1 million Index focusing on the entire DeFi trend. It is an example of one of the great things about DeFi - compositional. This feature allows one existing product to be used as a component of another. The DEFI ++ index includes the two previously discussed indices with the following composition: Capitalization: USD 0.6 million. . And even better, because you will pay a lot less for gas. Here we are exposed to the three fundamentally strongest trends in the crypto industry: Bitcoin, Ethereum and DeFi. Capitalization: $ 1.4 million. And even better, because you will pay a lot less for gas. Index designed by the creators of the DeFiPulse website. It can be said that this site is the CoinMarketCap counterpart for DeFi protocols. The index is based on the Tokensets technology and is available through this project. Index weights are systematically updated based on the capitalization of individual assets. Composition of the index: Capitalization: $ 23 million The index has a built-in fee of 0.95 percent of the index capitalization during the year. Finally, a very interesting ecosystem supported by a bigger idea. Not only creating token indices to have exposure to a given market. But also in order to use the management power of tokens in the index. Recall that most DeFi tokens are tokens that can be voted on in the protocols. Defining the directions of development or parameters of a given project. Few, however, use their tokens for these purposes. This is due, firstly, to a lack of awareness and, secondly, to the transaction fees associated with it. Collecting more of these tokens together in an index can be a factor in activating the management power of the tokens. Now let's move on to the two currently available indexes (more are on their way). An index that tries to reflect the strongest projects in the DeFi trend. Here is its composition Capitalization: $ 11.5 million Index for tokens related to. So, apart from YFI, we have on the list other projects co-created by Andre Cronje and projects with which Yearn Finance cooperates. Index Composition: Market Capitalization: $ 7.3M What would DeFi be without farming? Also, most of the solutions we have discussed allow you to derive additional profit from the index in the form of a protocol managing token, which is responsible for the creation of the index. Typically, this will be a reward for providing liquidity for the index in question. Annual rates of return on this account range from several dozen to several hundred percent per year (but remember which may eat some of the profits or even make us lose out on it). More time is dedicated to this aspect during our next one",https://www.zrozumiecbitcoina.pl/2020/12/18/zarabianie-na-indeksach-i-etfach-w-swiecie-krypto/,0
S&P 500 slips into a bear market as US stocks plunge on fears of a big rate hike after brutal inflation reading,"US stocks dropped Monday, with a broad sell-off putting the S&P 500 in bear-market territory — 20% down from its most recent high — as investors anticipate a big rate hike from the Federal Reserve this week after last Friday's grim inflation reading. Stocks sold off with the S&P 500 opening 2.4% lower. The Nasdaq Composite fell nearly 3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Index dropped by more than 600 points. In cryptocurrency markets, major tokens began selling off over the weekend, with bitcoin on Monday piling up additional losses to sink below $24,000. The total crypto market cap is under $1 trillion for the first time since February 2021. Investors are reacting to the May Consumer Price Index reading released on Friday which showed inflation rising at the highest rate in 41 years. The reading has caused a revision upward of many rate hike forecasts, with some observers now expecting an increase of 75 basis points this week. The expectation before Friday's CPI report was for the central bank to hike by 50 basis points. In a Financial Times poll, nearly 70% of economists said they expect the US to tumble into a recession as the Fed moves to combat inflation. Respondents largely expect the downturn to be officially declared in the first half of 2023 . Here's where US indexes stood as the market opened 9:30 a.m. on Monday: ""Big Short"" investor Michael Burry warned that inflation is set to surge even higher, and that more pressure will mount on the housing market . ""Transitory, no. Peak, no. To the moon? If you mean a cold dark place,""Burry said in a since-deleted tweet . Wharton professor Jeremy Siegel, for his part, said that even as hot inflation rocks the stock market, the index has probably already priced in a ""mild recession,"" so ""we're closer to the lows than the highs."" Meanwhile, bitcoin tumbled to an 18-month low as investors flee from riskier assets. It's now about 63% below last year's record high of $69,000. Crypto lender Celsius paused all account withdrawals and transfers amid the crypto sell off Monday. The company said the action was ""for the benefit of our entire community in order to stabilize liquidity and operations."" MicroStrategy plunged 26% Monday , as the bitcoin meltdown dragged the crypto market cap below $1 trillion. The company, led by crypto-bull Michael Saylor, faces a margin call if bitcoin falls to $21,000. Overseas, the yen dropped to a 24-year low against the dollar as investors bet the Bank of Japan will stick with ultra-low rates. Oil slipped, with West Texas Intermediate down 1.51%% to $118.81 a barrel. Brent crude , the international benchmark, moved down 1.37% to $120.34 a barrel. Gold edged lower 1.47% to 1,847.20 per ounce. The 10-year Treasury yield rose 10.6 basis points to 3.263%. Bitcoin fell 14.39% to $23,553.85.",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-news-today-sp-500-enters-bear-market-territory-2022-6,1
Miner Incomes Under Stress,"With the market trading near the price lows of the 2021-22 cycle, a great majority of investors are now holding unrealized losses. Furthermore, miners appear to experiencing some income stress, with revenues falling, whilst production costs climb. Coming out of a bloody nine consecutive red weeks, the market closed its first weekly candle in the green, albeit with a relatively uninspiring weekly gain of 1.57%. The market traded between a weekly high of $31,900 and a low of $29,375. With prices trading at the lower end of the 2021-22 cycle range, the vast majority of buyers from the last 17-months are now holding unrealized losses. The intensity of this uncertainty and stress in the market is observable in on-chain data, with a continual reliance on Long-Term Holders to shoulder the load. We are also seeing miner revenues decline substantially, despite the climbing difficulty. This suggests that miner operations have expanded, capital has been spent, and production costs have increased as revenues are falling off. As profit multiples compress across the board and financial stress increases, the highest probability is that the market is within the second and historically final capitulation phase of a Bitcoin bear market.",https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-23-2022/,2
"First Mover Americas: Bitcoin, Ether Plunge Anew as Celsius Halts Withdrawals","Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. I’m Bradley Keoun, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights. (Lyllah Ledesma is off.) Bitcoin ( BTC ) suffered one of its worst price declines of the year, tumbling alongside ether ( ETH ) and other cryptocurrencies as a fresh wave of panic struck traders just one month after the Terra blockchain's meltdown . As of press time bitcoin was down 11% to about $23,900, extending a losing streak that has now stretched to seven straight days. Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, plunged 16% to $1,232. The overall market capitalization of cryptocurrencies fell below $1 trillion for the first time since January 2021. The latest sell-off came as fears emerged of a new potential systemic threat to digital-asset markets, after the crypto lending service Celsius announced in a blog post that it was pausing withdrawals amid ""extreme market conditions."" The price of Celsius's CEL token fell over 50% after the news came out. Analysts also cited growing concern that the Federal Reserve may have to step up its campaign to tighten monetary conditions after a report Friday showed the U.S. inflation rate unexpectedly accelerating to a new four-decade high . Cryptocurrencies, like stocks, have come under harsh downward price pressure this year from the central bank's push to withdraw excess liquidity from financial markets. In traditional finance, U.S. stock futures were down, pointing to a dismal start to the week as signals appeared in the bond market that recession risk is rising .

In a letter to Celsius on Monday, Nexo said it was particularly interested in Celsius’ collateralized loan portfolio. Nexo publicized the letter , which didn't mention a price, in a tweet. The letter was from a business entity named Nexo AG in Zug, Switzerland, though Nexo's operations are based out of Bulgaria, Sofia, according to executives at the firm. Nexo said it was looking to acquire assets “mostly or fully of collateralized loan receivables secured by corresponding collateral assets, as well as brand assets and the customer database."" Celsius wrote earlier in a blog post that ""We are working with a singular focus: to protect and preserve assets to meet our obligations to customers.” “Our ultimate objective is stabilizing liquidity and restoring withdrawals, Swap, and transfers between accounts as quickly as possible,"" Celsius wrote. ""There is a lot of work ahead as we consider various options. This process will take time, and there may be delays.""

Wanna Bet? Crypto Prediction Markets Could Be a New ‘Source of Truth’,"AUSTIN, Texas — Will Monkeypox lead to the next major global pandemic? Will Russia and NATO engage in direct conflict before 2023? Will inflation rise above 8.6% this year? These are some of the questions a prediction market has a reasonable idea of answering. Though future events are always unknown, you can make reasonable bets about what may happen based on research, data and an understanding of trends. Crypto-based prediction markets make this “bet” explicit, by offering an opportunity for anyone to stake money on what they think will happen. Andrew Eaddy and Clay Graubard, founders of Baserate.io , discussed just this on the Big Ideas stage at Consensus 2022 in Austin, Texas, on Saturday. Their platform, called Baserate.io , is a media and information company leveraging forecasting technologies and prediction markets. See also: How Crypto Transforms Prediction Markets | Opinion For example, one user raised the question whether NATO will expand in 2022. Right now, the open market is voting no – shares predicting NATO’s expansion are currently trading hands at 53 cents. Though if these people are wrong, and NATO does expand, those that bought a “yes” vote (currently worth 47 cents) would have a greater economic return when the market closes and winners win the pot while losers lose their money. ""These are generally winner-take-all markets, and your probability of ‘crowd consensus’ is what people are willing to buy shares,"" Graubard said. He added that you can think about cents as a rough approximation of probability. ""They’re saying there's a 53% chance that NATO does not expand."" Although the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) may think otherwise – often shutting down prediction markets for violating regulations of binary markets – Eaddy and Graubard think these tools could do good for the world. If allowed to operate openly and publicly, they could help people make the right decisions. ""Blockchain technology will allow forecasts to be transparent, secure, immutable and more easily tracked,” Eaddy said. “Some of the other accouterment with blockchain, like DeFi technology, yield farming and liquidity provision, will also help to get more users on the platforms and also help the platforms generate this sufficient liquidity and volume actually to produce good, high-quality information,"" he added. At the end of the day, prediction markets are about accountability. Markets can reduce bias and opinions, they say, by allowing people to put “skin in the game.” You will only bet on the outcome you think will happen, not that you want to happen. See also: Why Crypto Whales Love This Prediction Market ""Being accurate is more important than saying the right thing for a particular audience,"" Graubard said. This has big implications for our messy, uncertain world, where trust in institutions is waning, Graubard said. It allows for new forms of trust to arise, primarily from the community on up. And, although prediction markets may or may not be just another form of crypto speculation, learning about the world is worthwhile. ""What's a better way than the process of finding out good information? I think having fun and also in the case of prediction markets, making money and forecasting.""",https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/06/11/wanna-bet-crypto-prediction-markets-could-be-a-new-source-of-truth/,4
Why Bitcoin Mining Is Taking Off In The Lone Star State,"By its nature, Bitcoin mining is energy intensive and incentivizes the use of cheap energy to turn a profit. Bitcoin miners have started to flock to Texas because of the current “goldilocks” situation for cryptocurrency mining created by three main factors: While Bitcoin mining has been criticized for being energy-intensive, Texas Governor Greg Abbott , among others, views Bitcoin mining as a solution to other related issues, such as taking advantage of untapped energy, including natural gas (such as surplus gas or associated gas) that would otherwise be flared or vented because of limited infrastructure to transport it to a destination. Source It’s no secret that for years , oil and gas companies have struggled to solve the problem of flaring, not only in Texas but across the U.S. Unlike oil, which can be transported by truck or rail, natural gas requires pipeline infrastructure to deliver it to market. If a driller has no means of transporting its gas, either economically or because there isn’t available pipeline infrastructure to do so, they flare (or burn) it, and the environmental implications of doing so are substantial . Instead, bitcoin miners can tap into this surplus gas, whether it’s the result of flared gas or bad netbacks, and divert it to generators, which then can convert the gas into electricity and then use it to power their sophisticated mining equipment. “Companies tapping surplus gas to run their cypto-mining computer banks see a double benefit – reducing the negative impacts of gas flaring and cutting their carbon footprint,” according to Argus Media . According to research from Crusoe Energy Systems, one of the largest Bitcoin miners in the U.S., the process reduces the carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by about 63% compared to flaring, Argus Media reported. This opportunity to repurpose otherwise stranded energy and monetize it has not only been attractive to Bitcoin miners, but also to oil and gas companies to increase returns on their production while also complying with environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives — more specifically, the “E” component for reducing their carbon footprints. Regardless of the energy source for the Bitcoin miner, be it the gas that would otherwise be flared or energy sourced by renewables, the Bitcoin miner essentially behaves like a power plant by purchasing power at an agreed-upon, fixed price and owning the ability to sell the power back to the grid. In contrast to Abbott’s position that cryptocurrency mining provides financial incentives to build power infrastructure and produce more energy, his opponents have argued that doing so would also trigger greater demand and stress on an already unstable power grid. Abbott’s position, however, relies on the belief that if a severe weather event occurred, such as Winter Storm Uri in February 2021 , which resulted in substantial surges in power demand, miners would be forced to pause operations when ordered to do so. In other words, miners would halt their operations and return the power to the grid when demand surges. This concept is not only supported by basic humanitarian principles, morals and ethics, dictating that power should be redirected to save human lives, but it’s also supported by the dynamic of the market itself. In the event of demand for power surges — as it did during Winter Storm Uri — spot power prices increase (sometimes dramatically) and therefore the miner would be financially incentivized to sell power back to the grid as opposed to consuming it. For miners, the benefits are not exclusive to their ability to source cheap power but also the flexibility and optionality to return that power to the grid. For Texas, particularly ERCOT , the state’s power regulator, the ability for miners to “turn off” during peak demand prevents the need to turn on less efficient peak demand power plants, allowing ERCOT to stabilize the grid more effectively. According to the Texas Blockchain Council , there are at least 27 mining operations in the state with more on the way. This growth is not only attributable to the points discussed above but also to the larger crackdown on bitcoin mining abroad, particularly in China, pushing many miners to flee to the U.S. It’s important to note that China is heavily dependent on “dirtier” energy sources such as coal, which produces roughly twice as much carbon dioxide emissions as natural gas . Meanwhile, Texas is home to “cleaner” sources such as natural gas and wind. Moreover, within the U.S., Texas is a leader in the nation’s wind-powered electricity generation, comprising approximately 26% of the nation’s total net wind generation. (Source: IEA) (Source: ERCOT Fact Sheet, May 2022) (Source: EIA) Altogether, these factors have incentivized and attracted Bitcoin miners to Texas with the Lone Star State becoming the fourth-highest hash rate (the measure of how much power is being supplied to the Bitcoin network) of any state, at approximately 14%. From Rockdale , Texas, home to the two biggest Bitcoin mining companies in the world, to the first city in the U.S. to mine Bitcoin, to Fort Worth , Texas, the Lone Star State is welcoming the Bitcoin mining industry with open arms.
